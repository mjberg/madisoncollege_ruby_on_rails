# Core Abilities
Madison College Core Abilities are eight key life and success skills that contribute to the development of students as life-long learners on the job, at home, and in the community. The Core Abilities are skills and abilities taught and assessed in classes, labs, and field experiences at Madison College. For more information on Core Abilities, please visit [http://madisoncollege.edu/core-abilities](http://madisoncollege.edu/core-abilities). This class addresses the following core abilities: Ethics

# Responsibilities and Policies
**Student Responsibilities:** Students are expected to be familiar with Madison College policies and procedures. Many of the important policies and procedures are on the Madison College website, located at [http://madisoncollege.edu/student-rights-responsibilities](http://madisoncollege.edu/student-rights-responsibilities).

**Academic Integrity** is an expectation in all Madison College classes. Plagiarism, cheating and collusion are prohibited at Madison College. Plagiarism is defined as passing of another person's work as your own. Students who fail to observe these standards are subject to disciplinary action. Madison College has a strong policy on Academic Misconduct which is published on the Madison College website. Please refer to this page on the Madison College Website to review all Academic Integrity and Misconduct policies located at [http://madisoncollege.edu/academic-integrity](http://madisoncollege.edu/academic-integrity).

**Withdrawal Policy:** If a situation arises that prevents the successful completion of this course, please note that it is each student's responsibility to formally withdraw from this course.

Nonattendance does not constitute an official withdrawal and students will be held responsible for tuition and fees not paid. Financial aid applicants and recipients may have their refunds delayed depending upon their financial aid status.

Stop payment of a check does not constitute a formal cancellation. Registrants will be held liable for the fee until the date of official cancellation. Allow four weeks from the date of cancellation to receive a full refund of payment.

**Attendance:** You are expected to attend class. Poor attendance can lead to failure in the class. If you cannot attend a class, it is your responsibility to obtain the material missed. Lecture will not be repeated for individual students. If you withdraw from the class, please notify me, and The Center for Agriscience and Technologies Office, room 173. Non-attendance will not automatically withdraw you from a course.

**Submitting Work:** All work must be submitted as directed in the assignment instructions.

**Backup Data:** You are expected to develop good computer use habits that minimize the impact of failure. I expect that you know to save your work frequently, after every major change, and to back up your work regularly. You should be able to backup your data to multiple sources.  I expect you to use Git for your source code management, commit early and often.

**Student Email:** Madison College offers a student e-mail account for all students. You are responsible for monitoring your student e-mail account. Student e-mail can be accessed at: [https://mail.madisoncollege.edu/owa](https://mail.madisoncollege.edu/owa%20) .

**Use of Electronic Devices:** Silence cell phones, mobile devices, etc during class sessions. Students must avoid non course related activities such as checking email or social networking sites, web surfing, or playing games because these diminish their—and their classmates'—engagement with instructional activities. Exceptions to this policy may be granted at my discretion.

Mobile devices, (including cell phones) must be stowed in an out of sight location during quizzes and exams and are not permitted to be on the desktop, handled, nor answered during testing periods. Students who disregard this policy will receive a grade of zero for the quiz or test taken during the offense.

**Technical Assistance:** You are encouraged to seek assistance from me well before the date that an assignment is due. This class is a troubleshooting type class, and the normal debugging assistance is available from me.

Student Computer Help Desk is located in the Truax Campus Library Room 230. Student lab assistants are available in person, and by phone, (608) 243-4444; toll-free at (866) 277-4445; by email at [http://madisoncollege.edu/help-desks](http://madisoncollege.edu/help-desks) to provide computer support to fellow students. These services are available Monday - Thursday: 7:30 a.m. - 9:00 p.m., Friday: 7:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m., and Saturday: 9:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. In addition, students can call an afterhours help desk until 10pm most days, by calling (608) 246-6666.

**Disability Act Statement:** Madison College complies with all provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act and makes reasonable accommodations upon request. Please contact Disability Resources Services at 246-6716 (Students who are deaf via Relay 711), room 159 at Truax or email drs@madisoncollege.edu

If you have an accommodation card from their office indicating that you have a disability which requires academic accommodations, please present it to me so we can discuss the accommodations that you might need in this class. It is best to request these accommodations at the beginning if not before class so there is ample time to make the accommodations.

**Class Cancellation:** Besides local radio stations and the Madison College website, students can call the hotline to inquire about weather related school closings. (608) 246-6606.

**Instructor Responsibilities:** As your instructor, I commit to communicating openly and frequently with you about this class. I will maintain a professional, safe learning environment adhering to the policies of the college. You can expect a reply to communication, be it via e-mail, voicemail or in person, within 24-48 business hours. I do work outside of teaching so my responses may come during the evening or over lunch hours.

**Exit Ticket:** At the end of every class I'll have you fill out an exit ticket. The exit ticket is un-graded and my way of taking attendance along with accessing your understanding of the material from the day. You will be directed to fill out the form at [http://exitticket.johnsonch.com](http://exitticket.johnsonch.com).

**Bitbucket** We'll use Bitbucket to keep track of our code for the semester [https://bitbucket.org/](https://bitbucket.org/). You may want to use Github on your own, but for your assignments the code should be on bitbucket as it is recommened by the school and used in the book. I encourage you to use and learn Github outside of class.

**Heroku** We'll use Heroku to deploy our apps to for projects and labs that require a deployment.  Signup for a free account from them.

Computer difficulties are not a long-term excuse for non-participation. If you experience problems with your computer, call the computer help desk at (608) 243-4444 or toll-free at (866) 277-4445. They can talk you through fixing many, many problems.
